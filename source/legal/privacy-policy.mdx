## Release time period

There is no set time limit for the Beta release period.

Products released in Beta may not ever be released into General Availability, but we will keep the product available as long as there is sufficient demand for the service.

---

## Support
Products released in Beta do not share a Support policy with those released in General Availability.

Because we are gathering feedback for Beta products, we have some realtime mechanisms such as Slack channels or via email.

We will not provide support for products in General Availability through these channels.

---

## Recommended use
While products are released in Beta, we do not recommend relying on them for software projects already released in production.

We also do not recommend using products released in Beta for highly sensitive data.

---

## Service abuse
We reserve the right to limit the activity of apps that cause issues.

While products are released in Beta, we will proactively manage system-wide usage to ensure that usage by one Customer does not affect service availability system-wide.

We will proactively communicate this to the app developer by email if an issue arises.

---

## Pricing
During the Beta release period, it is free to use the product.

We reserve the right to change this in the future.

---

## Product updates
Products that are released in Beta are likely to change more frequently than those in General Availability.

This includes changes to APIs and SDKs that could result in breaking changes for developers using the service.

We will communicate known breaking changes to users actively using Beta products by email.

---

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
Although we make security a top priority, products that are released in beta have not been tested for security vulnerabilities at the level that products released in general availability are tested.

While we encourage users to voice concerns about a product to us during the beta period.
