## Overview

The URL bar in the GraphQL app is the hub area for sending, saving and modifying requests.

You can specify the GraphQL endpoint in the URL field as well as set the request method that you want to set for your GraphQL request. The `Default` and `Project` environment snippets (if working with project) can be easily accessed as well from the URL bar. Request method available for use in the GraphQL app through the dropdown list is as follows:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTION
- PURGE
- LINK
- UNLINK

- PLACEHOLDER FOR URL BAR with the request method dropdown list open
