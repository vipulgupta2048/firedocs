## Overview

The response panel in the Firecamp API app is to view, format and get more information about the response of your request.

The panel provides a clear eagle-eye view of your response body as well as features to dive into headers, cookies, timeline and performance benchmarks associated with your request.

The response body can be presented as JSON or text by clicking the toggle buttons below the `Body` tab. With the options to copy, fold as well as word wrap if needed, the API response body can be viewed, and formatted as needed.

The response headers, cookies, and timelines for the response can be viewed by toggling through tabs. The `copy json` and `copy text` can be used to copy information in any format that is required.

## Headers

Response Headers provide information about the body and can be represented as the metadata for the response. A sample out from the `Headers` tab located in the repsonse panel is given below.

``` JSON
{
  "access-control-allow-credentials": "true",
  "age": "6792",
  "cache-control": "max-age=14400",
  "cf-cache-status": "HIT",

```

## Cookies

`Cookies` are used for sessions management. Information regarding cookies can be accessed through the cookies tab in the response panel.

## Timeline

`Timeline` tab in Firecamp helps developers get an overview on their request. Timeline provides session information, request and response headers, size of response data received, server certificates and more. This goes to be a great tool to debug response of your API's as it provides all information in a raw and compiled form.

## Performance Benchmarks

> Screenshot of API performance bar in response panel

The performance benchmarks listed on the response panel helps the user know more about API's performance traits. The first number being the status code returned, next being the response time of the API listed in milliseconds and last being the data transferred in kilobytes.

API app in Firecamp returns an appropriate status code so that the user can know the actual issue and process accordingly.

```
1. 1XX Codes: Informational Codes
2. 2XX Codes: Success Codes
3. 3XX Codes: URL Redirection
4. 4XX Codes: Error Codes
5. 5XX Codes: Server error
```
