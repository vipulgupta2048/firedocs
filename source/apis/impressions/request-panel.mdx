## Overview

The request panel in the API app is the hub for making requests to the API endpoint. Whether you are debugging your own API, integrating 3rd party API's or just experimenting with Firecamp you can easily get started on sending requests with Firecamp. Requests can be used to retrieve, add, delete, and update data as well as can be sent with a wide array of request methods, parameters, authorization details, and anybody data that is needed.

For example, if you're building an e-commerce application for your customers. Then, you can test and debug your API by fetching a list of recent customers, making a POST request to add a product to your product list and handle the login/logout request of the user.

When you send a request, Firecamp will show the response of the API server on the response panel with the functionality to view, format and copy the data received along with other information.
