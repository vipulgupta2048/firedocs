## Overview

`Params` or query parameters are parameters that are specified after the question mark (`?`) in the form of key-value pairs in the URL.

For example, breaking down the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts?id=12&name=vipulgupta2048

The protocol is https
The domain name is jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
The path to the resource (Path Parameter) is /posts
Finally, the query parameters being id=12&name=vipulgupta2048

Query Parameters are critical in sorting or filtering through resources for developers to find the right data. One can specify query parameters easily using the `Params` tab in the request panel of the API app.
