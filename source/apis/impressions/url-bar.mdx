## Overview

The URL bar in the API app is the hub area for sending, saving and modifying requests.

You can specify the API endpoint in the URL field as well as set the request method that you want to set for your API request. The `Default` and `Project` environment snippets (if working with the project) can be easily accessed as well from the URL bar. Request method available for use in the API app through the dropdown list is as follows:

- GET
- POST
- PATCH
- PUT
- DELETE
- HEAD
- OPTION
- PURGE
- LINK
- UNLINK

- PLACEHOLDER FOR URL BAR with the request method dropdown list open
