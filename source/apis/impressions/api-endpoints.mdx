## Overview

APIs are made up of endpoints - or separate URLs - that define what resources are available, which operations can be done on them, and what information is required when making a request. **API endpoints** facilitate the interaction of one system with another system that takes care of the processing and storage of data. An endpoint is a technical term associated with API's (Application Programming Interface).

In general, endpoints are the location where two software programs are allowed to communicate with each other. The endpoint refers to the location that the API service itself is located, while the resource refers to specific datasets within the server's backend. Beyond these two components, many URLs will also contain queries and path parameters that drill down into even more specific sets of data.

In other words, an API endpoint is a unique URL where requests sent by one program are answered and data in form of objects or collections of objects are returned from where the resource lives (Databases). In Firecamp, the URL bar can be used to enter API endpoints with request methods attached to it.
