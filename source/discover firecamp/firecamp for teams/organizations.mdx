## Overview

Firecamp is built with collaboration and accessibility in mind for teams working in a distributed environment. Providing features to setup Workspaces under organizations and invite members to those Workspaces to build, test and deploy your APIs faster while collaborating with your teammates.

## Organizations in Firecamp

Let's start understanding organizations through an overview of project management in Firecamp!

```
^ Organizations
    - There can be multiple organizations in Firecamp under a single account.
    - An organization can have multiple workspaces.
    ^ Workspaces + Members
        - Workspaces are a collection of projects, environment snippets, and members.
        - Multiple members can be invited to collaborate on projects saved inside Workspaces.

        ^ Projects
            - A workspace can have multiple saved projects.
            - A project can have multiple modules with requests and files saved inside them.
```

Organizations can be your company, startup or venture which hosts several workspaces for different purposes with team members having access to them and working together in sync on different projects.

## Creating your first organization

To create a new organization,
1. Click the downward arrow next to the current workspace name in the top-left corner of the Firecamp app.
2. In the menu that opens, click `Create New Workspace` to open the `Create Workspace` modal
3. Navigate to the `Select/Add Organization` and click the `+` button to create a new organization.
