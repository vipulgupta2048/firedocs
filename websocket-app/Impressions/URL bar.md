# URL bar

## Overview

The URL bar in the WebSocket (WS) app is the hub area for establishing, modifying and saving connections.

The URL bar is where you can specify the socket endpoint in the URL field and use the `Connect` button to establish a connection with the WebSockets. The `Default` and `Project` environmental snippets (if working on project) can be selected and modified from the dropdown menu located in the URL bar.
